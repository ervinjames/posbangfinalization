            <p class="skyblue-text">Views is the fourth studio album by Canadian rapper Drake. It was released on April 29, 2016,[6] by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records.[7] Recording sessions took place from 2015 to 2016, with both Drake and his longtime collaborator and record producer 40 serving as the records executive producers. 40 also primarily handled the production on the album alongside each of these several other record producers such as Nineteen85, Maneesh Bidaye, Kanye West and Jordan Ullman, among others. The album contains the elements of genres such as R&B, dancehall, hip hop and pop, among others.</p>

            <p class="skyblue-text">The album's title was first announced as Views from the 6, as it first appeared from a report in a July 2014 article from Billboard.[12] According to Drake on Twitter, "the 6" is a reference to his hometown of Toronto, Ontario. On April 29, 2016, it was revealed that the title had been shortened to Views.[13] The cover artwork for Views was released via Drake's Twitter account on April 24, 2016, which features Drake sitting atop the CN Tower in Toronto. The fact that Drake was significantly larger than life-size on the cover was widely discussed,[14][15] and CN Tower's Twitter account later confirmed it to be photoshopped.</p>

          <p>The album was supported by five singles: "Hotline Bling" (which was included as a bonus track), "One Dance" featuring Wizkid and Kyla, "Pop Style" featuring The Throne (Jay Z and Kanye West), "Controlla" and "Too Good" featuring Rihanna.[8] "One Dance" became Drake's first number-one single in 10 countries as the lead artist, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. The single spent 10 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and 15 weeks on the UK Singles Chart.

Views was met with lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom found it to be an overlong retread of Drake's previous work. Despite this, it spent 13 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200. Views became the first album to accumulate one-billion streams on Apple Music.[9] On December 1, 2016, Views was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[10] As of January 2017, Views sold 1.61 million recognized copies and a total of 4.14 million album-equivalent units in the United States.[11] Views was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the 59th Grammy Awards. Additionally, "Hotline Bling" won for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, respectively. And the single version of "Pop Style" featuring The Throne was nominated for Best Rap Performance.</p>

          <h4>L I F E by D R A K E / / </h4>
          <p class="left-align light" class="white-text">Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986)[1] is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor.[2][3] Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.


          <h4>E A R L Y  L I F E by D R A K E / / </h4>
          <p class="left-align light" class="white-text">Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Bass guitarist Larry Graham and the late songwriter Teenie Hodges are his paternal uncles.[20][21][22][23][24] Drake's mother, Sandi Graham (née Sher), is a white Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. Drake attended a Jewish day school, and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.[25][26][27]

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father chose to return to Memphis in order to find a way to supplement himself financially.[25][26][27] As a child, he witnessed his father's arrest while visiting him in Memphis.[28][29] His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells for a song entitled "Drake's Dad", detailing the events that had occurred following his departure from Drake's early life.[30]

Drake was raised in two polarizing Toronto neighbourhoods; he lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end,[28] until the sixth grade. In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[31] Drake then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.[32][33] When asked about the move to Forest Hill, Drake replied, "[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school.[34] He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood, Drake described the school as "not by any means the easiest school to go to. [It's tough]."[28] Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background,[35] and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school.[36] He later graduated in October 2012.[37].

          <p class="left-align light" class="white-text">Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010,[5] which debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His next two releases were 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same,[6][7][8][9] with certifications of quadruple and triple platinum respectively in the U.S., with the former also earning him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. They were followed by two mixtapes, with the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late, and a collaboration with Future for What a Time to Be Alive, in 2015. The former was certified double platinum in the U.S.[10]

Drake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking several chart records in the process.[11] The dancehall-influenced Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks,[12] becoming the first album by a solo male to do so in over 10 years. Its single "One Dance" topped the chart in several countries, including the U.S., the UK and Canada, where it became his first number-one single as the lead artist. This saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, coming close to a record held by Whitney Houston.[13] It achieved quadruple platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release.[14][15] The single "Hotline Bling" secured him his second and third Grammy win, for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, at the organization's 59th ceremony.[16]

Alongside his Grammy Award wins, Drake has won three Juno Awards and six BET Awards. He has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts.[17][18]

Drake has developed other ventures, including his OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator Noah "40" Shebib. Drake acts as a producer, producing under the pseudonym of Champagne Papi. Using the "OVO" moniker, Drake has his own clothing line and his own channel on Beats 1 Radio. He is also currently acting as the global ambassador for NBA franchise, the Toronto Raptors
